# Assessment Instructions

In general terms, your task in this assessment is to refactor and extend the current node application.

The hypotetical scenario behind this assessment is the following:

_The application was developed by a team which is handing over the codebase to your team. In the process of handing this over, a senior developer wrote a basic code review with suggestions and observations around what could be improved in the code base. You can find the developer review on the file called `REVIEW.md` in this repository._

**Task 1**: You were appointed by your team to spend some time refactoring the code. You should follow the review file but bear in mind it is not extensive so please don't feel like you should do _only_ the things listed there. There is definitely more things that could be done to improve the code base.

**Task 2**: You need to develop and document a new endpoint in this API. Please, read the file `API_EXTENSION.md` file for further instructions.

You are free to use any library you want to accomplish the tasks. Just remember that even though it is a small contrived codebase, you must treat it as you would treat any application in production.

Your code will be assessed on the base of software development best practices, especially around code readability, extensability, coupling, testability and modeling.
